On Week 13, I was waiting for [Bug 1260714](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1260714) to be merged to mozilla-central. It was on Sunday to Monday night, making my week a success even before I woke up :)

The week before, Patrick Brosset asked me on IRC if I was willing to work on [Bug 1260510](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1260714). The rule panel was empty when a stylesheet contained a data-uri sourcemap, although there should be rules shown. I worked on it all week long, and during the process, I encountered another bug, this time in the Style editor. If an inline style tag contains a sourcemap reference, the original file (which might be a SASS, Stylus or LESS one) couldn't load.
I fixed this and pushed a patch to the bug Patrick pointed me at. Rightfully, he indicated me that the patch did not adress the particular bug and that I should file a new one ([Bug 1260510](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1260510)). So did I, and asked there for review on my patch.

The original bug was resolved by a fix on another bug by Patrick ([Bug 1255787](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1255787)), but someone commented on it to say there were still seeing it.
After they gave a test case for it, I was able to spot the problem, which is slightly different : if the `<link>` href is generated with `URL.createObjectURL()` and contains a sourcemap, though the Rules panel is empty. I filed a bug for it ([Bug 1263439](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1263439)), and pushed a patch for review too.

I worked on a couple other bugs too, but I'll talk about it when I ask for review on them.

This week I also attended two meetings : the devtools team meeting on Tuesday, and another one on Friday which Patrick invited me in. The latter was about bug triaging on the inspector.

Saturday I also got the confirmation that I'll attend the Mozilla All Hands in London this June !
