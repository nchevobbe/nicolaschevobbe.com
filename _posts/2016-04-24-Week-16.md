On week #15, I attended an inspector bugs triage meeting, in which people working on the inspector categorize the bugs created the previous week. In this meeting, Patrick Brosset told us that he curated a list of P2 bugs which should be fixed before the other P2 — bugs that are not really critical, but that are quite bad and could harm the user experience. I found it great, because now I can pick the bugs I want to work on in that list, and I'm sure that they matter for the team and the product.

So this week I worked on a bug in the markup view ([Bug 1232806](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1232806)). If you started to drag a node from the markup view, and dropped it outside the devtools' window, the drag state of the component was messed-up and you could drag another node, with the first one still being dragged, resulting in an akward tag soup. This was due to the fact that we were tracking the `mouseup` event only on the body of the markup view, and thus, if we released the mouse elsewhere, it wasn't handled.<br>
I spent some time searching a solution for this. I tinkered with a non-standard API, [setPointerCapture](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/element/setPointerCapture), that allows to track mouse position outside of the element the listener is attached on. I had a working patch and submitted it to review. Julian Descottes asked me there if I tried to declare the listener on the `window` instead of using `setPointureCapture`, because it might be a good solution for this. So I tried to do what Julian advised, and it indeed worked. I was quite surprised and I did learned something, which is why I do this challenge, so that's great.<br>So the thing is, if you have a `mousemove` listener on the `window`, it will only trigger if you move inside this window. __Unless__ you have the mouse button down, in which case the `mousemove` (and `mouseup`) listeners are triggered even if the cursor is outside the window.<br>
I edited my patch and pushed it to review again, which Julian granted quickly. Bug resolved !

While I was working on the drag and drop bug, I chose another bug from the P2+ list ([Bug 820926](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=820926)). This bug aims to better display void elements in the markup view. A void element is one that could not have content inside its opening and closing tags, think `<br>`, `<hr>`, `<img>`, … (see [https://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/syntax.html#syntax-elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/syntax.html#syntax-elements)). Currently, these nodes are displayed with a closing tag (e.g. `<hr></hr>`), which, even if not wrong, does not help the user to aknowledge that non-closing tags are perfectly valid in HTML.

Julian Descottes helped me a lot for this bug, and I'm now waiting for Patrick to come back from vacation to push my patch to review.

This week, I also kept on working on the new console frontend. The short-term goal is to be able to land this new experiment onto the official devtools repository (which could happen every two weeks). So the things I worked on were mostly related to have a stable state in the console. Here's my pull requests that have been merged :

- Modify message component's root element to add category and severity attributes ([Pull #64](https://github.com/bgrins/gecko-dev/pull/64))
- Add a MessageIcon component ([Pull #70](https://github.com/bgrins/gecko-dev/pull/70))
- Standardize component imports across the new console code ([Pull #73](https://github.com/bgrins/gecko-dev/pull/73))
- Fix eslint errors and console warnings ([Pull #74](https://github.com/bgrins/gecko-dev/pull/74))



And that's it for week #16, see you later !
