On Monday, I was waiting for review on [Bug 1208204](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1208204), which aimed. They were some minor nits to fix, and my edited patch landed on Wednesday.

I also had a pending review for [Bug 1247243](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1247243), which contained some server side tests I had to create. After some back and forth, and a rebase, I was r+'d and thought everything was good. I pushed my patch to TRY and oh boy it saved my ass. I quickly saw that 2 tests were failing pretty badly. I did not executed those tests while developing as they were on a different folder from the one I added my test to. I edited the tests and made sure every of them pass, and pushed a new patch to review on Thursday.

As my week was a success and I had a pending review, I search a new Bug to work on. I found [Bug 711942](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=711942), which goal is to have a visual editor to edit angle units ( deg, grad, rad, turns). This is kind of rad ( :D ), and kind of what the Devtools are heading to : provides easy and visual ways to edit the styles of a webpage ( [see this article from Patrick Brosset on Medium](https://medium.com/@patrickbrosset/devtools-for-creative-people-1eef09c1ec0d#.h02wzq5ri) ).Patrick chimmed in the bug's comments, and proposed that we should also allow the user to switch from units with Shift+Click, just like we do it for the colors. I accepted the challenge and [Bug 1250835](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1250835) was created for this purpose.

On the same time, Tim N'Guyen reaches me on IRC and told me he gave me editing and assigning permissions on Bugzilla, which mean I can assign myself on whatever bug I want to work on, without asking to someone from the team ! He also pointed me to [Bug 1246514](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1246514) and asked me if I was willing to work on it. The goal is to switch the toolbox options panel from XUL to HTML. I started looking around to see how things work for this, and I'll continue to work on this this week.

On Tuesday, I released Bugzilla Timeline.

Feedback was quite positive and I was given some ideas on how to make it more fun.

This week, I also moved my blog posts from CodePen to my own website. I had a proper domain for several years, but I cancelled my Linode subscription a year ago as I was barely using it. A tweet from Sara Soueidan followed by a quick chat made me realize I could use Github pages, like I do with Bugzilla Timeline.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="fr"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wish developers/designers wrote more articles on their own blogs. I’d rather share links to those blogs than to articles on Medium, tbh.</p>&mdash; Sara Soueidan (@SaraSoueidan) <a href="https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan/status/702063641877725184">23 février 2016</a></blockquote>

Github Pages provides a Jekyll integration to handle static sites. It is new to me, so the whole thing is not perfect yet, but it's good to have my words on my site. I will eventually enhance it, when I have some free time ( not immediatly so ).

So next week I'll work on the XUL to HTML conversion bug and on the angle units in the rules panel. I will be in Dijon for 2 days, at my company's office, for some meeting with clients. Hopefully I'll dodge over the flu that's spreading there. If so, see you next Sunday :)
