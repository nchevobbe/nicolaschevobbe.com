After I got hooked on ES6 Promise ([see my article on my company's blog (FR)](https://blog.atolcd.com/index.php/2015/03/24/async-les-promesses-javascript/)), I wanted to learn more about ES6/2015. Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunities to explore it more in my day-to-day job. The only solution I could see was having a side project to hack on during my free time. But the thing is : I'm not able to do personal side projects. I usually tinker with ideas for a day or two, sketching stuff, making big plans, and ending never stick with it because of my laziness.

So this time, I wanted to find an open-source project to contribute to, and get some peer pressure/cheering to keep me motivated on the long run.

Fortunately, I discovered not so long ago that the Firefox Developer Tools ([@FirefoxDevTools on twitter](https://twitter.com/firefoxdevtools)) were mostly based on frontend-technologies, and that it heavily uses new Javascript features as soon as they land in the browser.
As a regular and proud user of Firefox since version 2, and heavy user of the DevTools, it sounds to me like a great project to contribute to.

I've been following Mozilla employees (or now former employees) on Twitter for ages. People like Tristant Nitot ([@nitot](https://twitter.com/nitot/)), Christian Heilmann ([@codepo8](https://twitter.com/codepo8/)), [Paul Rouget](http://paulrouget.com/), Robin Hawkes ([@robhawkes](https://twitter.com/robhawkes/)), and so many others forged my opinions in favor of the open-web and the values of the Mozilla Manifesto.
I truly think Mozilla shaped the web platforms as we know it today and I really love the idea of contributing for a great non-profit foundation, which aim to make the web better for Internet users, and which have higher human goals than economic ones.
Contributing to a tool that is used by thousands of people, helping make developers' job easier would be a blast !

I remembered a tweet by Patrick Brosset (<a href="https://twitter.com/patrickbrosset">@patrickbrosset</a>), saying that there were mentored bug on the platform. I picked an easy one using [http://firefox-dev.tools/](http://firefox-dev.tools/) , and start toying around.

In late 2015, I fixed my first bug ever for an open source project :

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="fr"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">First <a href="https://twitter.com/FirefoxDevTools">@FirefoxDevTools</a> fixed <a href="https://t.co/FX1Y6bdILZ">https://t.co/FX1Y6bdILZ</a> Easy one but I thought the process of getting involved was much harder. Mores to come !</p>&mdash; Nicolas CHEVOBBE (@nicolaschevobbe) <a href="https://twitter.com/nicolaschevobbe/status/675298795115159552">11 DÃ©cembre 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It felt great, I picked another bug, struggled a little while fixing it, and Patrick almost resolved it himself.

With Christmas and New-Year's Eve holidays, I realized that there would be some times when I won't be eager to work on the project, and I was afraid of not contributing so much due to my laziness. I need something to motivate me all year long.

So for 2016, I thought about a challenge, I will try to fix one bug each week.
I know that some bugs should take more than a week to fix, between the discussions, the reviews, and you know, life. But I'll try to start to work on a new bug each Monday of this year. There will be some times when I won't have much time and then I'll take easy bugs ( that's not cheating right ? ). My family skiing holidays mid-January should be a good test for this.

I started working on a dashboard in order to show me how I keep up with this.

I'll also try to write each Sunday how I fixed the bug of the week ( if I succeed it ), what I learned from it and how things went.

I don't trust myself too much, but I'll do my best to succeed this challenge and become a steady Mozilla contributor this year !
