On Week #19, I worked on [Bug 1271191](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1271191) to add support for #RGBA syntax on the devtools. I was waiting for review, which was granted and the bug was resolved on Tuesday.

The previous week, I also worked on a bug whose goal was to display properly cased tag names all across the devtools ([Bug 1270215](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1270215)). I ended up creating a new property on the NodeFront, `displayName`, which is the concatenation of `Element.prefix` and `Element.localName` (if prefix exists). I then added a handful of tests to make sure everything was fixed, and after some back and forth due to stupid mistakes, the bug was resolved on Friday.

I tried to finish fixing [Bug 1248274](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1248274), an issue about editing property in the rule view. I was waiting for review on my patch. There were some things I hadn't thought of :

- we have the same problem with url property value (the link is clickable, and if you are editing a property, it take an extra click to open it)
- we shouldn't update the property value if the property name is not modified
- for ease-of-test's sake, we should emit an event when the property value is updated.

I'm still working on this, there's some challenges to fix it due to some race conditions.

I worked a bit on the new React-based console frontend, especially on making the console output objects ( Object, Array, Node, ...), using [Reps](https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?q=path%3Areps&redirect=false&case=true), which are components created by a member of the devtools team, Honza, and are already used in the DOM panel. There wasn't much to do as the components already do the heavy work. I just had to add some props to display things differently (e.g, not displaying surrounding quotes on a string). I am not done with this one yet, I'm waiting for feedback on a pull request to know how far should I go and how I can tackle some issues that showed up.
