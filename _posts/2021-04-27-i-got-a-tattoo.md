In the beginning of 2021 I got my first tattoo:

Yes, that's (almost) the Firefox DevTools WebConsole icons, but there's more to it.

It all started last year, in Berlin, where Mozilla held the last All Hands before the pandemic really hit.
I can't remember the detail, but at some point [Jason Laster](https://twitter.com/jasonlaster11) suggested I should get a WebConsole tattoo, and for some reason, it stuck in my head.
I wasn't ready to get it right away, I didn't had any tattoo before, and although it always attracted me, I always feared I would get bored of a piece in the long run.

But here, it was different. The design came to my mind pretty fast, and it was simple and small, and it felt like I wouldn't get over it over time.
It would be a reminder of how contributing to Firefox DevTools changed my career and my life, taking me to a place I wouldn't have dreamed off when I was a student.
Taking a step further, this also represents how much I love being a programmer, after all it's a classing REPL design, which we interact with every day.
And further away, it can be seen as a symbol for Persistance: you have to put effort **IN** to have a chance to get something **OUT** (even if not guaranteed).

I sat on it for a while, and some events made me think of another bigger, tattoo idea. The WebConsole tattoo now felt like an harmless thing I could do to check if I could handle being tattooed (I don't handle pain and anxiety very well).
I took the plunge in the beginning of January and got the tatto without fainting (it was close though ðŸ˜…).

To the next one now ðŸ™‚
