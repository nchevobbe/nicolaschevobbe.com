Last week-end I attended the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/">FOSDEM</a> conference in Brussels (more on that later). One of the talk I was really looking forward to attend was about <a href="https://securedrop.org/">Securedrop</a>, an encrypted application that allow communication and document sharing between whistleblowers and journalists (See <a href="https://video.fosdem.org/2018/H.1301/securedroppresentation.mp4">"Securedrop" talk  </a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/redshiftzero">@redshiftzero</a>).

The talk was really interesting and resonated with an article from The Intercept I read not long ago: 
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/01/03/my-life-as-a-new-york-times-reporter-in-the-shadow-of-the-war-on-terror/">"My life as a new york times reporter in the shadow of the war on terror"</a>. 

The post explains how the attitude of the US government towards leaks shifted after the 9/11, and how it gradually went after sources and journalists that were revealing secret operations, with absolutely scary digital spying bits (the journalist was told to stop Googling someone&nbsp;!).

Hence the need for Securedrop app, which goals is to allow sources to leave as few data trail as possible. Which can be really tricky, especially for non-tech saavy people; even searching for "securedrop" is already a trail that can be used against a source ("why did you search for that&nbsp;?").

I was astonished by the level of security journalists have to go through to use Securedrop (non-connected workstation, in dedicated rooms, using single-use USB bootable OSes,&nbsp;â€¦).

The talk and the article are complementary and I encourage you to look at them if you have an hour to spare.
