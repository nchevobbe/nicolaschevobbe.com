Before joining Mozilla this year, I never had a chance in my carreer to go to any conferences, but was watching a lot of talks in my spare time. One of the really nice thing about being a Mozilla employee is that you get an annual budget to travel to and attend conferences. So I took this opportunity to head out to Stockholm, Sweden üá∏üá™, and go to [Nordic.js](http://nordicjs.com/).

I had heard of this conference before, since both [Soledad Penades](https://twitter.com/supersole), a former DevRel now part of the [DevTools team](https://twitter.com/FirefoxDevTools), and [Lin Clark](https://twitter.com/linclark) ‚Äî who I consider being one of my mentor ‚Äî gave talks there in the past.
This was also a good opportunity to visit Stockholm in the weekend which I was told was beautiful (spoiler: it is).

Nordic.js is a single track conference which means that as an attendee, you don't have to choose which talk to watch: you see everything. The venue has a really nice mix of arty and industrial vibes and the 2 days went very smoothly, with good beverages and food, regular breaks and Fika (Swedish coffee break with pastries), techno/laser ping-pong and [code in the dark](http://codeinthedark.com/) competition at the closing party.

The hosts ‚Äî [Unn Swanstr√∂m](http://www.twitter.com/unnderbar) & [Mattias Petter Johansson](http://www.twitter.com/mpjme), aka mpj ‚Äî were excellent and funny, and I was really impressed with most of the talks, so here is an excerpt of the ones I enjoyed the most.

<h2 class="talk-title">State of JS 2017</h2>
By [Sacha Greif](http://twitter.com/SachaGreif)

[The state of Javascript](https://stateofjs.com/) is survey aimed to surface if people have heard of specific JS flavors, libraries, framework and tools, if they want to use it, or if they used it, whether they will use it again or not.
This gives a good picture of what devs (who took the survey), know, use and like in the JS ecosystem.
Sacha gave an entertaining talk despite being full of figures, which is something to praise. He put up a JS library name quizz in the middle of his talk which was quite fun (How cool üèÑ SkateJS üèÑ is, right ?!).

The nice thing was that the numbers of the 2017 surveys were compared to the 2016 ones, so he was able to surface trends in the JS community. In summary, more and more people use or want to use ES6, React, Vue, Webpack and GraphQL, and most of the people like it. This is interesting for my team since we try to make developers life easier, so knowing what they use can gives us direction on what to work on. For example the rising use of Webpack means that we better have a pretty good support for sourcemaps (which we now do üôÇ).


<h2 class="talk-title">Sociolinguistics and the Javascript community: a love story</h2>
By [Harriet Lawrence](https://twitter.com/harrietgl) ‚Äî [Slides](https://github.com/harrietgrace/talks)

I think this was to me the most interesting talk of the whole conference, with plenty of great insights on how to make a project a place where **every** people can thrive.

It's important to know what the community looks like, i.e. don't be like the Linux Kernel mailing list.
A good-community project should be:
1. Welcoming
2. Learner-Focused
3. Community-Focused

You should not use irony, or make jokes on a person PR because you never know how the author will take it. This is something I observed personally at my old job, what someone think is a simple "harmless" joke, can make someone feel like üí© for a couple of days.
When doing reviews, it can be nice and cheerful to call out for people good works. I think this has nothing to do with the [shit sandwich](http://blog.idonethis.com/sandwich-feedback-performance-management/), it is just about saying "üëç" when someone actually did a good job.

It is also a good thing to normalize failure. You can show that in multiple ways:
  - "senior" members of a project should show their struggles and vulnerabilities, so newcomers don't feel bad when they do struggle on something
  - Talk about things that went badly
  - Avoid using words like "easy", "just", "simply". What is simple for one might be extremly hard for another.
  - Document what can go wrong
    - Give links to documentation or FAQ
    - Tell how to debug an issue
    - Give a link to an IRC/Slack room where people can have their questions answered
  - Open the conversation about learning at all stages of your life and career

Legitimate peripheral participation like:
  - Answer questions on slack
  - Writing blog posts
  - Writing docs
  - Translating UI
  - Point to unanswered questions on StackOverflow or in your issues

These are as important as writing code, so say it loud!

<h2 class="talk-title">You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off&nbsp;!</h2>
By [L√©onie Watson](https://twitter.com/LeonieWatson)

The presenter is a blind developer working on the Government Digital Service in the UK.
The talk was about how easy it is to alter the web experience for people using screen readers, and how to use aria attributes to provide them a good way to interact with your web page.
She also insisted on the fact that accessible webpages not only benefit screen-readers people, but everyone since you then have better keyboard navigation, which power-users use more than the mouse.

The proper thing to do as a web developer in the first place is to **not use aria attributes**. Instead, you should ensure that you are using the proper HTML elements for the work they have to do (e.g. do not use styled `<span>` or a `<a>` as buttons, use `<button>`). However, it might happen that you do need to use non-semantic elements for a given UI element. In that case, use the proper aria attributes, and most important, don't override native accessible elements.

There is a new specification coming for accessibility, <a title="Accessibility Object Model spec" href="https://wicg.github.io/aom/spec/">AOM</a>, which will be way more powerful than ARIA. But as they said:
<blockquote>With great power comes great responsibility</blockquote>
and it will be even easier to mess up with the accessibility of websites.

<h2 class="talk-title">Best Practices for reusable UI components</h2>
By [Mars Jullian](https://twitter.com/marsjosephine) ‚Äî [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/marsjosephine/nordicjs-best-practices-for-reusable-ui-components)

Great talk by an engineer at Netflix on how to build a UI component library. This was mainly about using React, but some principle are applicable with every library. This talk was quite relevant to my current interests, since I'm working on a [set of components](https://github.com/devtools-html/devtools-core/tree/master/packages/devtools-reps) that are meant to be used across the devtools to preview variables.

Mars pointed that a good reusable UI component should be:
  - self sufficient
  - easy to integrate with

Self sufficient means that the component need to handle just enough state to be useful.
A component will be easy to integrate with if it let consumers (parent components) what it's doing.
One good thing in React to do such thing is to have meaningful propTypes so the component is self documented. You should also try to merge props when it's possible. For example, if you have a component that has a header which can contain a simple label, or a label AND a logo. Instead of having `label` and `logo` props, maybe you can only have `label` and make it accept both strings and React elements.

Even if the component needs to be easy to integrate with, you don't want your component to be used in unwanted ways: you need to remove backdoors. A backdoor can be directly applying the props passed to the component; this way, the parent can even highjack lifecycle functions like `componentWillUpdate`. You should only cherry-pick the prop that you allow in your component, and provide hooks, if you want it.

<h2 class="talk-title">The future of the web and the curious case of the unintended silo</h2>
By [Paul Kinlan](http://www.twitter.com/Paul_Kinlan)

My second most loved talk after the one from Harriet Lawrence. I am aware of Paul Kinlan works since I heard about WebIntent.

What he means by Silo is that a data that you chose to hand to a specific website often cannot be used seamlessly in another one. For example if you upload a photo on Google Photo, you can only edit it using the tool provided by Google Photo, you rely solely on what the website provides.

The goal of Paul is to make the web an equal partner on all platforms, and make users use web most of the time.
He then went through a whole bunch of existing or soon-to-be web APIs that would allow web app to be more capable :
  - Crediential Management API (less friction to signup/log in)
  - MediaSession API (media control from the phone status drawer)
  - WebBluetooth
  - NFC API
  - WebUSB
  - postMessage + MessageChannel + Proxy API ‚Üí comlink (communication from workers to workers across different origins)

All of this, combined with underlying-PWA mechanisms (ServiceWorkers and Add to home screen), makes the web a more suitable platform to work on that closed native platforms.

But the web shouldn't be chasing the native rainbow, as we shouldn't look only at hardware access to compare it to native application. The web is, and need to keep being:
- Secure
- Linkable
- Indexable
- Composable
- Ephemeral

The talk represented everything that I feel and think about the web, which is a wonderful platform that top or even outperform native applications, if you look at the correct metrics. On this subject, I also encourage you to read [Henrik Joreteg's "Betting on the Web"](https://t.co/gKs7hkXKmd).

<h2 class="talk-title">Down the Rabbit Hole: JS in Wonderland</h2>
By [Claudia Hern√°ndez](https://twitter.com/koste4)

This was a very playful and funny talk about [JSFuck](http://www.jsfuck.com/). This is a really creative ways of doing things only using `()+[]!` characters. I don't have enough space to explain it here, but the talk was really nicely done and provided a fresh bowl of air just before lunch üòÄ.

<h2 class="talk-title">The Design and Evolution of Event-Driven Databases</h2>
By [Mark Nadal](https://twitter.com/marknadal)

Mark Nadal is the creator of the [GunDB](http://gun.js.org) library, and claimed to take us on a journey to write an entire database in 30 minutes. He then went through a bunch of already written code which he explained at a very high speed. I wish I could understand everything that was going on during this talk. The presenter was very enthusiastic but maybe the subject was too broad to fit in ~30mn, which made Mark rush through his code. He even did a lightning talk the day after to explain a concept more in detail, but again, this was too technical for me to understand.
At least I came home with some concepts to look at (Radix tree, CRDT, ‚Ä¶), and I hope to be able to get my hand on GunDB to grasp the concept behind it because it looks awesome.

<h2 class="talk-title">Builing inclusive communities</h2>
By [Karolina Szczur](https://twitter.com/fox) ‚Äî [Transcript](https://medium.com/@fox/building-inclusive-communities-232dc01d1aba)

This talk was closing the conference and had a very different tone that all the other ones. You should go and read the transcript. In short, we should be actively fighting the unfair status quo in the tech industry, not look away, be allies, speak up, even more if you are in a situation of privilege. But really, read the transcript or watch the video when it's out.

Overall this was a very good first time at a conference for me, and I'm looking forward the next one (if you have suggestions, reach out [@nicolaschevobbe](https://twitter.com/nicolaschevobbe))
