          <aside class=notes>We have this website we send contributors to when they are
            looking for a first bug to work on.
						On this site you can get a list of bugs in the Firefox DevTools, and filter them

						contributor working on the bug.
            This site has a few issues that I would like to fix, using the Firefox DevTools.

          <h1>INSPECTOR</h1>
          <aside class=notes>
            So let's start with the design of this site.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section data-panel=inspector>
          <h2>Photon Colors</h2>
          <img src="./assets/inspector-design.png">
          <aside class=notes>
            First thing you notice when you open the inspector is the new colors, using the
						Photon Design System which is the one powering Firefox Quantum.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section data-panel=inspector  class=smaller-center>
          <h2>Whitespace only text node</h2>
          <p class="content">See Patrick Brosset's post on <a href="https://medium.com/@patrickbrosset/when-does-white-space-matter-in-html-b90e8a7cdd33">whitespace only nodes</a></p>
          <img src="./assets/inspector-whitespace-only-text-node.png">
          <aside class=notes>Here I have an unordered list of inline-blocks links, and I see there's
            some space between links, wich I don't understand because I did not set any padding.
            If I open the Inspector, I'll see a little dotted icon in the tree. And if I hover it,
            it will tell me that it's a whitespace only node, and will highlight it in the content page.
            So now I can see who's responsible for this 3.54px gap, which designers might be really
						interested to know about.</aside>
        </section>

        <section data-panel=inspector>
          <h2>Animations</h2>
          <p class="content">Easing curve</p>
          <video src="./assets/inspector-animation-too-short.mp4" loop></video>
          <aside class=notes>Another thing that bother me in this page is the look of the "loading" logo.
            The page is said to be loading when we are fetching for a list of bugs . And here, in the animation panel,
            we can see that we rotate the logo in a very linear way.
            So let's try to get this better.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section data-panel=inspector>
          <h2>Toggle classes</h2>
          <p class="content">Easier to trigger the animation</p>
          <video src="./assets/inspector-toggle-class-loading.mp4"></video>
          <aside class=notes>First, I need to actually trigger the animation. I can go and
            select a different tool on the left panel, but it is a bit limited since the
						animation stops when the loading is over.
						What I see, is that we add a "loading" class to the body of the page when
            we load it.
            So let's do that using the ".cls" button in the rule view. It allows me to easily add
            a class, and then toggle it. This way, I can trigger the animation in a breeze.
          </aside>
        </section data-panel=inspector>

        <section data-panel=inspector>
          <h2>Toggle classes</h2>
          <p class="content">Multiple classes</p>
          <video src="./assets/inspector-toggle-class-loading-dark.mp4"></video>
          <aside class=notes>By the way, this UI is not restricted to only one class. You
            can add multiple ones and play with them. For example, we have a dark mode on this page,
            and we can see how the page looks when it's loading, both in light and dark mode.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section data-panel=inspector>
          <h2>Animations</h2>
          <p class=content>Multiple properties and easing</p>
          <video src="./assets/inspector-animations.mp4" loop></video>
          <aside class=notes>Let's go back to the animation, I made some changes tweaking the rules.
            Now I have 2 separate properties animated, "transform:scale", and "opacity",
						with different easing.
            I can hover the curves to see the properties of the animation, and I also can
            hover specific keyframe to check a given property value.
            Now the animation looks fine to me, let's move on something else.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section data-panel class=smaller-center>
          <img src="./assets/bug-finder-before.png">
          <aside class=notes>One of the other issue I see on this page is that it could be
            better for first time contributors.
            The current look is a bit dull and the links are hard to spot.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section data-panel=inspector>
          <h2>Landing page</h2>
          <img src="./assets/inspector-intro-blank.png">
          <aside class=notes>
						So let's try to put up a landing page so users can have a better grasp what the page is about.
						Here you can see what the page looks like unstyled, and we are going to set up some rules in
						the inspector to make it look better.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section data-panel=inspector class=smaller-center>
          <h2>CSS custom properties</h2>
          <pre class=content><code data-trim>

          </code></pre>
          <img class=center src="./assets/inspector-rule-autocomplete-css-variable.png">
          <aside class=notes>First we want to have a nice, branded gradient background color.
            I took some of the CSS custom properties, or CSS variables, of the Photon Design System.
            Then I can go into the Rule view, and type my gradient, the variable names are autocompleted.
          </aside>

          <img class=center  src="./assets/inspector-rule-variable-value.png">
          <aside class=notes>And then I can hover a specific variable to see its value. It is also shown in
            the rule view, but this is more convenient.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section data-panel=inspector>
          <h2>Font</h2>
          <p class=content>Applied fonts are underlined</p>
          <img class=center  src="./assets/inspector-rule-font.png">
          <aside class=notes>
						For a more branded look, I want to use the Zilla font on this page, for the title.
						Zilla is the font used in the new mozilla logo.
						A nice little touch in the Rule view that landed a few weeks ago
            is that you can see the applied font on a given element. So if you are missing one font
            on your computer, or if a web font did not get downloaded,
						you can see that the fallback is being used.
          </aside>

        <section data-panel=inspector>
          <h2>Font panel - system</h2>
          <img src="./assets/inspector-font-panel-local.png">
          <aside class=notes>Which makes me think that you can go the the Font panel, and check
            the font properties. You can even enter a custom text to see what the font looks like .
            Here it is for a system font, installed on my computer .
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section data-panel=inspector>
          <h2>Font panel - remote</h2>
          <img src="./assets/inspector-font-panel-remote.png">
          <aside class=notes>And you can see other properties on remote fonts, like the font-face declaration</aside>

          <h2>CSS Grid</h2>
          <main class=hero style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); height: 100%; grid-gap: 1em;">
            <div style="grid-column: 1 / 2; grid-row: 1 / 2;background-image: url(./assets/people-jen-simmons.jpg); background-size: cover; height: 33vh; background-position: center;"></div>

            <hr style="grid-column: -2 / -1; grid-row: 1 / 2;border: 5px solid var(--accent-color); align-self: center; width: 90%">
            <div style="grid-column: -2 / -1; grid-row: 1 / 2;background-image: url(./assets/people-wes-bos.png); background-size: cover; align-self: end; height: 33vh; background-position: center;"></div>
          </main>
          <ul class=content style="list-style: inside;list-style-type: '-';">
            <li><a href="http://labs.jensimmons.com/">Jen Simmons'&nbsp;lab</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://gridbyexample.com/">Rachel Andrew's "Grid by example"</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://cssgrid.io/">Wes Bos' free course</a></li>
          </ul>
          <aside class=notes>Now let's get to the bigger part of the inspector.
            CSS Grid is a set of new properties that let you declare layout in a very simple
            way. If you are not familiar with it, you can check the work of Jen Simmons, Rachel Andrew and Wes Bos,
            just to name a few, who put terrific resources to learn CSS grids.
						By the way, this very page is using CSS grid.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section data-panel=inspector>
          <h2>Grid Inspector</h2>
          <p class="content">Set up a grid</p>
          <video src="./assets/inspector-grid-display.mp4"></video>
          <aside class=notes>So I want to use it as well for my landing page. Let's put display: grid on the
            container. And then, you can see there's a little button next to it. When it is clicked it shows
            the boundaries of my grid elements.
            The colors does not play nicely here, so let's change it to something more noticeable. White should be good.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section class="experimental" data-panel=inspector>
          <h2>Split rules panel</h2>

					</main>
          <aside class=notes>Then I am going to share a secret with you. We have been
            working on a way to have 3 panels displayed on the inspector at the same time.
            This way, you can see and set things even more easily.
            So here I opened the 3rd panel and I can see both my rules, where I will set up
            my grid properties, and the layout panel.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section data-panel=inspector>
          <h2>Grid Inspector</h2>
          <p class=content>Declare a grid template</p>
          <video src="./assets/inspector-grid-template-columns.mp4"></video>
          <aside class=notes>So let's declare a simple grid template of 4 columns.
            You can see that both the content and the layout panel are updated in real time.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section data-panel=inspector>
          <h2>Grid Inspector</h2>
          <p class=content>Title at the top</p>
          <video src="./assets/inspector-grid-title.mp4"></video>
          <aside class=notes>Now I can place my title to take an entire row thanks to
            the line indicators of the Grid inspector.

        <section data-panel=inspector>

          <h2>Grid Inspector</h2>
          <p class=content>Links</p>
          <video src="./assets/inspector-grid-links.mp4"></video>
          <aside class=notes>And the links in a new line. After that I apply whatever the
            internet told me to use with flexbox so it looks nice.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section data-panel=inspector>
          <h2>Flexbox inspector</h2>
          <p class=content>Coming soon</p>
          <img src="./assets/inspector-flex.png">
          <aside class=notes>And for those of you like me, we are working on a Flex inspector
            so it's easier to understand what is going on with your flex items.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section data-panel=inspector>
          <h2>Named areas</h2>
          <img src="./assets/inspector-grid-template.png">
          <aside class=notes>One last nice trick in the Grid inspector. In my CSS I declared
            some areas so I can name areas instead of dealing with lines and column numbers.
            And I can then display those names by checking the appropriate checkbox in the layout panel.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section data-panel=inspector>
          <h2>Shape path tool</h2>
          <video src="./assets/inspector-shape-circle.mp4">
          <aside class=notes>Okay, so things are getting pretty good I think.
            But I think we can do even better. So there's an experimental properties called
            shape-outside which let's you define non boxy shapes for content to float against.
            So basically, here I have a float div, with a shape outside set to circle.
            And there's a button I can click which will show me the actual shape.
            And I can manipulate it in the page and see how content react to that.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section data-panel=inspector>
          <h2>Shape path tool</h2>
          <video src="./assets/inspector-shape-polygon.mp4">
          <aside class=notes>There are other types of shapes, like polygon for example. And you can also
            manipulate it using this tool.

          <h1>DEBUGGER</h1>
          <aside class=notes>Okay, so now we have a good looking landing page. What's next ?
            Well, I heard of small library made by a small company. It's called React.
            Okay, so let's try to use it to build our website. And because we're building something new

             Oh, and by the way, You can expand all the children of a node by doing Alt + Click on it.

					<aside class=notes>So, usually, when you debug something, it involves a lot of clicks
            on step over, step-in, step-out function so you can get to the actual faulty line.
            I sometime even do add a breakpoint 5 lines after the paused line so I don't haveto click multiple times.
            Now in the debugger it's even simpler because I can right click on the line
						I want to go to, and select "continue to here".
            In my case, I did not even had to do that, because it was the first line that was faulty
            with "this" being undefined.
            And I know why it is undefined, it's because I did not bound this to my method, like
            React ask you too.

					 <p class=content>Let the debugger handle your breakpoints</p>
					 <aside class=notes>So, here  I added a constructor to bind my method, and I reloaded my page.
						 Do you see what happened ?
             Even if I added 4 lines, the debugger is still where I want it to be, on the "searchBugs"
						 variable assignment.
             It's because the debugger has what we call AST breakpoints. Which means, breakpoints are
             not only referenced by a file and a line number, but also by an ast location.
						 Here it is the "searchBug" variable  assignment
             in the onComponentChange method. I find this very useful because you can tweak your
             code and not have to deal with your breakpoints being on a whole other expression you don't care about.

             If you don't know styled console message, it's a nice little thing that let
             you style parts of your message using a whitelist of CSS properties. The way you
             do this is by declaring a style unit, with %c, and css properties on the last arguments
             of console.log calls. This way you can build fun helper function to have rainbow logs.

             it will copy the JSON stringified version of the object, if possible, in your clipboard,

           <aside class=notes>Which takes us the JSON viewer. This view is activated each
             time you try to see a JSON file, either a direct .json file, or a response with
             a correct JSON header content type. It should have the same style you set up
             in your DevTools so you won't damage your eyes if you are used to the dark mode.
             It is pretty awesome as it gives you a full page JSON explorer, so you don't lack
             space and have a better overview of what's in the file response.

           <aside class=notes>The other nice thing, especially when dealing with github apis,
             is that since links are automatically transformed to actual html links, you can navigate
             across endpoints.

          <span class=content>React, Redux, Angular, …</span>
          <aside class=notes>First is DevTools webextensions support. the extension team, with
            sometime some help from us, did a tremedeous job so we can benefit from all the
            chrome extensions that are already out there. So things like React Devtools, Redux Devtools, Angular
            works directly in Firefox. here is a screenshot with the website I almost successfully switched to React.

           <h2>Firefox Screenshot</h2>
          <video src="./assets/misc-screenshots.mp4"></video>
          <aside class=notes>Second is Firefox Screenshot. This you don't need to install, it
            is baked-in Firefox. It tries to find the container when you mouse over something, and you
            can then save locally, to your clipboard or to the cloud where you can assign it a life span.
            My favorite workflow is copy to clipboard then paste into Slack or Sketch. No more temp files
            everywhere in your Desktop.

           <h2>Multi-Account Containers</h2>
          <img src="./assets/misc-containers.png">
          <aside class=notes>And the last shout-out is for the Multi Account containers extension.
            It let you have multiple "identitites" in the same browser. It is very useful if
            you are working on a site with different user roles. So here you can set them as container,
            and not have to log out and log in again with a user with the correct role. Super helpful.
